### Integration Points

#### New Planning Page
- Visualization appears in the results section after calculation
- Shows the optimal layout with all pieces positioned on sheets
- Helps users understand the efficiency of their cutting plan

#### View Historic Page  
- Added visualization to the project details dialog
- Users can view saved cutting layouts for any project
- Provides visual confirmation of past optimization results

### Technical Implementation

#### D3.js Features Used
- SVG rendering for scalable graphics
- Data binding for dynamic cut positioning
- Color scales for visual differentiation
- Interactive events (hover, mouseover)
- Tooltip creation and positioning

#### Layout Algorithm
- First-fit decreasing bin packing approach
- Considers piece rotation for better space utilization
- Handles multiple sheets when cuts don't fit on single sheet
- Optimizes for material efficiency

#### Waste Detection Algorithm
- **Grid-based Analysis**: Uses a 10mm grid to identify unused rectangular regions
- **Rectangular Region Finding**: Efficiently detects larger waste areas that could be useful
- **Minimum Size Filtering**: Only highlights waste areas larger than 20Ã—20mm
- **Overlap Prevention**: Ensures waste areas don't overlap with placed cuts
- **Performance Optimized**: Fast algorithm suitable for real-time visualization

#### Data Structure
```javascript
layout: [
  {
    sheetNumber: 1,
    cuts: [
      {
        cutId: 0,
        width: 800,
        height: 600,
        x: 0,
        y: 0,
        rotated: false
      }
      // ... more cuts
    ]
  }
  // ... more sheets
]
```
